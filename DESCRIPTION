Description: This is used to quickly make a transect of 2D point data carrying data.
    This data needs to be formatted as data.frame or tibble with 3 columns: x, y, data (usually Mg/Ca).
    It consists of two functions: make_crop() nd make_trace(). 
    The first one helps to focus on a specific area of the map, but it is not necessary.
    The second plots the data and then lets you choose the position of the transect.
